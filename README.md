Project Goals

This project is for an e-commerce website for a hypothetical business called Beyond the Barbell.

Beyond the Barbell is a business to customer (B2C) e-commerce site, selling products to users - such as health products, clothes, and gear. Additionally, users can subscribe to the box/gym with different variations of subscriptions as well as buy personal training sessions. As a member, the user can also write reviews of personal trainers, as well as sign up for competitions offered.

Features of this business-focused website include a shopping cart, a catalogue of products, an online payment system that can save the customerâ€™s preferred mode of payment, sign up for an email newsletter, contact us page, and private policy statement.

The site was developed using Python in the Django framework and styled using CSS and Bootstrap. ElephantSQL is used for the database and Heroku for deployment.

## Agile Tools

The Projects section in GitHub was used for this project. A Kanban board was used for the development of this project, which made it possible to break down the project into subtasks and make it easier to complete and track project progress.  In addition, labels were used to further define the priority of each user story in the Kanban board.

# Design and Structure

The layout and design of this site was kept basic and simple. Minimal color was used to keep it simple. [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used for simple color choices. This website is meant to be functional and therefore I kept the color palette simple and something similiar to what you would see in an actual gym.  


## Kanban Boards

[Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Jaimilit/projects/6) was used to create this project.
User Stories were moved through the process from To do >> In Progress >> Done on the Kanban Board.
All User Stories were prioritized: Must Have, Should Have, & Would Like to Have. Each user story was also linked to a milestone as well.

Here you can see my overview of my kanban board and moving items around as I was working on them.
![Kanban Boards](./media/kanbanprogress.png)

Here is an example and this one has the can see the labels and milestones connected to it.

## Functional Structure
Home page: The home page contains a navigation menu, logo, and an image that gives the user an idea of what the website is about. Here users are given a option to join or go to any of the  links in which they are interested in.

Registration page: The user must create an account to make a purhcase or to sign up for a competition. To do this, they are asked to fill out a form on the page with the required fields: Email, username, & password. They will need to confirm their email address.

Sign In/Login page: A username/email and password are required to log in for existing users. Once signed in, they are directed to the home page.

Logout page: Logging out of the account is done through the menu, after which the user is redirected to the logout page where they must confirm their desire to log out of the account. After a successful logout, the user is returned to the home page.

Products page: A user can view all the products offered and sort through the products offered. Can sort by category, rating, & price. 

Train With Us: There are two options here: Memberships & Personal training sessions. Memberships to purchase are 3, 6, & 12 months, while a user can purhcase personal training sessions in 1, 5, or 10 sessions.

Competitions: You must be logged in to join a competition, but here users can see which competitions they are join. They can also view and delete their competitions as well.

Connect With Us: Here users have a few different views: Contact Us, Reviews, Newsletter & Private Policy. The contact us page the user can complete a form to contact us. The reviews page a user can view personal training reviews and write their own review which will be approved by admin prior to posting. Users can also sign up for a newsletter, as well as view the private policy statement.

No known bugs remaining

### Manual Testing

Testing was done throughout the process while developing the project by the use of Django debug pages and printing statements to check that the code functioned accordingly. In addition, thorough testing has been performed and is described below, it contains manual test to check that all user stories and acceptance criteria are met, as well as testing and validating the code with different online tools as presented below.


### Browser Testing

Testing has been carried out on the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari

The site was constantly tested during the process of creating the site in the Gitpod Environment and the deployed site on Heroku was also tested in terms of user experience. The available functionality and user experience is reflected in the table below.

* Example of format issue for the layout of the success page.
![Layout Format for Success Page](./static/assets/images/bugs/bug-layout-success.png)

* Example of issues with functions between booking and booking_session not working correctly. Automated testing to fix issue.
![Booking Issues](./static/assets/images/bugs/bug-testing.png)

| Bug| Solution | 
| ------- | ------- |  
|  Issue with bookings showing all on Mondays | Need to adjust the book_session and booking functions |
| Issue with filtering objects if booking_exists to be able to later change the booking  | Use print states and True/False to find the error |
| CSS issues on Successful Booking Page | Ensure all classes were correct, as well as divs | 
| Delete Booking wouldn't go to delete_booking page | Needed to rework delete function and return renders outcomes | 
| When Debug was set to False, none of the CSS was displayed in Heroku app| Python command to collect static files | 
| When trying to implement 20 max for session, it would write none instead of a message when at 20 spots| Change functions and create error page | 
| When I was creating the editing function I first used the booking form to edit, but then the user could change the username and workout session | I created a new form which was just the note so that could be edited| 


## Validation

### HTML Validation:
The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to validate the HTML of the website. There were errors and warnings in the reports about unclosed elements and tags, incorrect values â€‹â€‹and types of elements, and unnecessary trailing slashes. All errors and warnings have been fixed, the project's HTML code has been re-checked without significant errors.

It shows one error here and I have fixed it, but it still shows.
![HTMl Validation](./static/assets/images/validations/html.png)


### CSS Validation:
The website CSS style has successfully passed the W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service.
![CSS](./static/assets/images/validations/css-validation.png)

### Python Validation (PEP8)
All Python code was manually checked using CI Python Linter. The Linter reports had messages about exceeding the string length of 79 characters, which have been fixed. Re-testing did not reveal any errors.

* urls.py

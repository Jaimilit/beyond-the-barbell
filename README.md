Project Goals

This project is for an e-commerce website for a hypothetical business called Beyond the Barbell.

Beyond the Barbell is a business to customer (B2C) e-commerce site, selling products to users - such as health products, clothes, and gear. Additionally, users can subscribe to the box/gym with different variations of subscriptions as well as buy personal training sessions. As a member, the user can also write reviews of personal trainers, as well as sign up for competitions offered.

Features of this business-focused website include a shopping cart, a catalogue of products, an online payment system that can save the customerâ€™s preferred mode of payment, sign up for an email newsletter, contact us page, and private policy statement.

The site was developed using Python in the Django framework and styled using CSS and Bootstrap. ElephantSQL is used for the database and Heroku for deployment.
